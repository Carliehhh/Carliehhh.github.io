			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>"Finally you will be among peers who understand you. Maybe you'll even make some friends..." Netflix has revealed an official teaser trailer for their new series titled Wednesday, their Addams Family spin-off live-action series directed by the maestro of macabre, Tim Burton. Who's ready to watch this already!? It is described as a coming-of-age supernatural mystery comedy focusing on Wednesday Addams and her years as a high school student at Nevermore Academy, where she attempts to master her psychic powers, stop a killing spree, and solve the supernatural mystery regarding her own family â€” all while navigating her new relationships. Jenna Ortega stars as Wednesday Addams, with the series cast featuring Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Percy Hynes White, Gwendoline Christie, and Christina Ricci. This is one epic, grandiose teaser introducing a very rotten, extra dark young woman coming in to her own at Nevermore Academy. This looks like it's going to be devious fun! Check it out below.</p>
